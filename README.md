# Contact-Dice
 A comprehensive demonstration of contact points and normals on a mesh, using a dice as the primary object of illustration.

This Unity project serves as a demonstration and tutorial on how to determine the contact point and normal in a specific collision event. The project focuses on simulating a dice roll and capturing collision data, such as:

**Contact Points** – The exact location where the dice makes contact with a surface.
**Collision Normal** – The perpendicular vector at the point of impact, which can be used to determine the surface orientation.
**Practical Applications** – This data can be utilized for physics-based reactions, impact effects, or game mechanics that rely on precise collision detection.
This tutorial provides a clear breakdown of Unity’s OnCollisionEnter and OnCollisionStay methods, along with debugging tools like Gizmos and Debug.DrawRay to visualize collision normals in real time. Whether you're a beginner learning physics interactions or an advanced user refining object behavior, this project offers valuable insights into Unity’s collision system.

-New note-

This dice system uses real-world physics to determine outcomes, where the result is based on the opposite of the contact normal—meaning the face pointing upward after impact. Instead of traditional numbers, the dice reflects common productive habits observed in workers, making it both data-driven and insightful.

Beyond dice rolling, this method can enhance physics-based reactions, impact effects, and collision-driven mechanics in games. This tutorial also covers Unity’s OnCollisionEnter, collision normals, and debugging tools like Gizmos and Debug.DrawRay, offering valuable insights for both beginners and advanced developers.

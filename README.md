# Contact-Dice
 A comprehensive demonstration of contact points and normals on a mesh, using a dice as the primary object of illustration.

This Unity project serves as a demonstration and tutorial on how to determine the contact point and normal in a specific collision event. The project focuses on simulating a dice roll and capturing collision data, such as:

**Contact Points** – The exact location where the dice makes contact with a surface.
**Collision Normal** – The perpendicular vector at the point of impact, which can be used to determine the surface orientation.
**Practical Applications** – This data can be utilized for physics-based reactions, impact effects, or game mechanics that rely on precise collision detection.
This tutorial provides a clear breakdown of Unity’s OnCollisionEnter and OnCollisionStay methods, along with debugging tools like Gizmos and Debug.DrawRay to visualize collision normals in real time. Whether you're a beginner learning physics interactions or an advanced user refining object behavior, this project offers valuable insights into Unity’s collision system.

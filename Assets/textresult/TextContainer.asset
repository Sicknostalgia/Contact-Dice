  paragraphs:
  - Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be
    in silence.
  - As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
  - Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull
    and the ignorant; they too have their story.
  - If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always
    there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.
  - Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.
  - Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in
    the changing fortunes of time.
